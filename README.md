### Project Overview
Welcome to the "Glowing Aliens" project at JUMP! This interactive art installation features translucent mannequins that light up in response to sound, creating a dynamic and engaging experience for viewers. The installation was originally exhibited at our festival for light and color, Illumibrate 2025. We are excited to open this project to the public and invite you to contribute your own creative versions of the code to control the LEDs and Alien Visitors!


### How It Works
The Alien Visitors are equipped with LED lights that respond to audio input, creating a glowing, pulsating effect. Here’s a quick overview of the technical setup:

### Technical Setup
Microcontrollers: Arduino Nano.

LED Wiring: A ws2812b LED strip with 150 RGB LEDs are wired to a data pin on the arduino board and to a power supply. More detailed photos and wiring diagrams can be found below.

Audio Response: The lighting reacts to audio signals, using code you can find in this repository under the alienAnimation folder. You will also be able to see the other projects and tests we compiled for Illumibrate. Those aren't on display, but they may give you more ideas we were working with.

For a more detailed look at the setup and how to replicate it, check out the technical documentation and wiring diagrams below.

### How You Can Contribute
We’re inviting the public to participate and create their own versions of the code! Here’s how you can get involved:

Fork the repository to make your own copy of the project.

Modify the code to create new lighting effects, patterns, or behaviors for the mannequins. Let your creativity run wild!

Submit a pull request with your changes. Along with your code, please include a README file that explains:
- What your code does.
- The creative goals or concepts behind your version.
- Any additional instructions needed to run your code.

### Recognition
We’ll feature your submissions in our lobby display, and we’ll recognize contributors through signage that highlights those who have shared their work. Your name or handle will be proudly displayed to celebrate your contribution!
